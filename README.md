This project is a memory card game Super Mario theme based. The idea is that the user will match all the card pairs in order to finish the game. There is a time limit of 60 seconds and a score of 1000 points to which every click deducts 20 points.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The red color used is one of the super mario colors. The grey color on the card front (when flipped) intends to make it easier for the user to identify the cards left to match. As the colors of the characters are all very similar, the user would easily get confused once only a few pairs would be left to match (if using black as the card back).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font-family "Press Start 2P" was picked to give the game a retro aspect. Sans Serif is the fallback font used in case the 'Press Start 2P' isn't being imported              into the project correctly
    -   #### Imagery
        -   All the images are characteres of Super Mario as it is the theme of the game.
